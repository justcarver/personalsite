# Justin Carver's Personal Site

A pesonal site project created using GulpJS.

Created as part of Code Louisville.

I am currently using Gulp features for the following
- Convert Sass .scss files to CSS
- Minify my JS files
- Set up BrowserSync for testing
- Build the production version of the site from projet files.

All current working project files are in the app folder.

Node.js settings are in the package.json
GulpJS settings are in the gulpfile.js
